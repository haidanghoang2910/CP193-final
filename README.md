# CP193-final

The file included is for all the Python implementation that I have done up until now. In the first section, you will find the implementation of 3 models I mentioned in the iterative work: Facebook Prophet, ARIMA and Random Forest. These implementations aim at estimating future stock prices. I used Google's stock prices. Each model is tested by splitting the data in a training set and a test set, then calculated the RMSE, MSE and MAPE.

In the second section, you will find the same implementations but applied on two other stocks - this is to make our comparison and model choice more robust. Detailed insights extracted from this section can be found in the pdf iterative work submission, under Part C: Extraction of insights.

In the third section, you will find the Markowitz optimization - this section uses the prediction results from Random Forest (our chosen model).

In all sections, detailed explanations, in-line comments and docstrings are used to explain the rationales - please refer to them for more information.
